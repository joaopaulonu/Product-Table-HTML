**Product Table**

The "Product Table" project aims to demonstrate how to create a basic product table using only HTML. The table structure is made up of elements like table, tr, th, and td, which help organize the product data such as name, description, and price. Although the project itself is simple, it serves as a useful introduction for beginners to using HTML tables.

Each product has a "Buy" button, which can easily be configured to perform a future action, such as redirecting the user to a payment page or adding the product to a shopping cart. This provides the foundation for expanding the project with more advanced features, like JavaScript for dynamic interaction.

While there is no advanced styling in this project, it can be expanded with CSS to improve the appearance of the table and make it more visually appealing. Additionally, the button functionality can be enhanced with JavaScript, making the project even more interactive.

This is an excellent exercise for those just starting with HTML, allowing them to understand how to structure and display data in an organized way, with the flexibility to improve and expand the project over time.
